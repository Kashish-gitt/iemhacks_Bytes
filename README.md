PROBLEM STATEMENT-
1) Most of the Colleges  doesn't have the Online Dispensary
System. Many a times students face problems of keeping the track record
of all the prescriptions and medical test reports safely.
2) For the doctors as well, it would be easy and more efficient to examine the
patient/student, if their past health records would have been handy and
easily accessible.

3) Keeping the records of all patients check-ins using usual Pen-Paper Mode
is a challenging job for the concerned authorities too. In the uncertainity of
life and our hectic life schedule, there is no saying when you get to call in a
doctor and take precautionary measures.
4) It's not done here, it also leaves a huge scar on the environment as well.
Lot of paper is used and wasted in the medical field for such a minimal
task, which leads to Deforestation which in turn creates a imbalance in our
Ecosystem. Wastage of resources at this cost is quite inappreciable.
